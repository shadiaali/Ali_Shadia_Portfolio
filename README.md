# Portfolio

My portfolio


### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smalfoy/Ali_Shadia_Portfolio.git
```

Open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd Ali_Shadia_Portfolio
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. The site will not show properly unless these steps are followed. In development mode, the portfolio needs to be run on a live server (MAMP/WAMP) in order for the database and json to work.
